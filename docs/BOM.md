## Rationale for Selection
Each component was selected based on its compatibility with the designed system, availability, and cost-effectiveness. Additional spare components were ordered to account for potential damage during assembly and testing.

### Component Rationale
1. **ESP 32 S3 WRROM N1** - Selected as the main microcontroller due to its powerful processing capabilities, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth support, and integration ease with other components.
2. **USB Connector** - Necessary for interfacing with external devices and powering the microcontroller during development.
3. **CAP CER 22UF 10V X5R 0201** - Used for power stabilization and noise reduction in voltage regulation circuits.
4. **CAP CER 10UF 25V X5R 1812** - Chosen for smoothing power fluctuations in critical circuit areas, ensuring reliable operation.
5. **CAP CER 0.1UF 630V X5R 1812** - Helps filter high-frequency noise and improve the performance of the power supply section.

## Conclusion
This BOM ensures that all necessary components are accounted for and easily accessible, allowing for smooth project execution and debugging.
