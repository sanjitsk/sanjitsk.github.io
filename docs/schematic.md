# Schematic
This schematic outlines the design of a subsystem centered around the ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N4 microcontroller, which is responsible for communication with the MQTT server and integration into a daisy chain system. The design includes a switching voltage regulator that provides a stable 3.3V output to the ESP32, UART communication lines for bidirectional data exchange, and essential debugging components such as status LEDs and buttons for enabling boot and reset modes. The system’s connectivity is designed to ensure seamless integration with other boards in the daisy chain while enabling efficient communication with the MQTT server. Each component is chosen to meet the specific requirements for robust embedded system design, ensuring reliable operation across multiple interconnected devices.
