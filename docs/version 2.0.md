# Version 2.0 Hardware Design Improvements

In planning a **Version 2.0** of our MQTT & Processing subsystem PCB, we’ve identified several areas—based on our current schematic and real-world testing—where enhancements would bolster reliability, manufacturability, and feature set.

---

## 1. Enhanced Power Management

### 1.1 Higher-Efficiency Regulator
- **Current:** AP63203WU-7 buck converter (≈85 % efficiency).  
- **Improvement:** Upgrade to a synchronous buck converter with ≥95 % efficiency (e.g., TI TPS62840).  
- **Why:** Reduces heat dissipation at higher loads, extends battery run time, and shrinks PCB thermal relief area.

### 1.2 Input Surge Protection & Filtering
- **Current:** Schottky diodes (D1/D2) for basic reverse-polarity protection.  
- **Improvement:** Add a TVS diode on the 5 V input and an LC EMI filter before the regulator.  
- **Why:** Guards against voltage spikes on long cables, reduces conducted EMI from switching, and improves EMC compliance.

## 2. RF & Antenna Optimization

### 2.1 Certified SMD Chip Antenna  
- **Current:** PCB-etched edge antenna footprint.  
- **Improvement:** Use a certified chip antenna plus matching network (e.g., 0 Ω/1 pF/1 pF Pi-filter).  
- **Why:** Delivers consistent range across production, minimizes layout-dependent tuning.

### 2.2 RF Ground Isolation  
- **Current:** Shared ground pour for digital and RF.  
- **Improvement:** Split ground plane with dedicated RF ground under antenna and a 50 Ω controlled-impedance feedline.  
- **Why:** Reduces RF currents coupling into digital paths, lowers packet loss, and aids certification.

## 3. Signal Integrity & Testability

### 3.1 Dedicated Test Points  
- **Improvement:** Add labeled 1.27 mm-pitch test pads for 3.3 V, GND, UART RX/TX, I²C SCL/SDA, RESET.  
- **Why:** Facilitates in-circuit testing and manual debugging, speeding assembly validation and bring-up.

---

## 4. Mechanical & Assembly Enhancements

### 4.1 USB-C Consolidation  
- **Current:** DC barrel jack + Micro-USB for power/programming.  
- **Improvement:** Migrate to a single USB-C connector with Power Delivery and UART over USB.  
- **Why:** Simplifies cable management, future-proofs the design, and offers reversible insertion.

### 4.2 Fiducials & Panelization  
- **Improvement:** Add three non-functional copper fiducials and mouse-ear tooling holes.  
- **Why:** Improves pick-and-place accuracy and OLA alignment, reducing yield loss.

---

## 5. Layout Refinements & Documentation

### 5.1 Silkscreen Clarity  
- **Improvement:** Increase font size for critical labels (J1, U1, LEDs) and add orientation markers.  
- **Why:** Reduces assembly errors and speeds visual inspection.

### 5.2 Layer Stackup & Copper Balance  
- **Improvement:** Adopt a 4-layer stackup (Top, Ground, Power, Bottom) with solid planes.  
- **Why:** Improves thermal performance, reduces EMI, and simplifies routing.

**Conclusion**  
These Version 2.0 improvements spanning power, RF, signal integrity, mechanical assembly, security, and documentation—leverage our existing schematic insights to deliver a more robust, manufacturable, and feature-rich hardware platform. Each enhancement aligns with user needs for reliability, scalability, and ease of production.
